``high_pass``
*************

(**Required**, float between 0 and 1): *alpha* smoothing factor for the high pass filter and controls
the attenuation of the low-frequency components of the signal.

Basic `high pass filter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter>`__ for the sensor values,
assuming the sensor values are sampled at a constant rate. This filter will remove low-frequency
components and offset from the sensor values. 

The formula for the high pass filter is: ``y[i] := α × y[i−1] + α × (x[i] − x[i−1])``, 
where ``x`` is the input value and ``y`` is the output value.

A large α implies that the output will decay very slowly but will also be strongly influenced by 
even small changes in input.

A small α implies that the output will decay quickly and will require large changes in the input
to cause the output to change much

A value of 0.5 (when time constant equal sampling period) might be a good starting point.
