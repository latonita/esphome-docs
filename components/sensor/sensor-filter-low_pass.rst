``low_pass``
************

(**Required**, float between 0 and 1): *alpha* smoothing factor for the low pass filter.

Basic `low pass filter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter>`__ for the sensor values,
assuming the sensor values are sampled at a constant rate. This filter will remove high-frequency
components and noise from the sensor values.

The formula for the low pass filter is: ``y[i] := α * x[i] + (1-α) * y[i-1]``, 
where ``x`` is the input value and ``y`` is the output value.

A lower α implies that the output will respond more slowly to changes in the input but will also
be less influenced by noise. We can say the system has more inertia.

A value of 0.5 (when time constant equal sampling period) might be a good starting point.
